# My Machine Learning Journey

Welcome to my Machine Learning learning repository! This space documents my progress, projects, and experiments as I delve into the fascinating world of ML. My goal is to build a solid foundation in various ML concepts, from data preprocessing to implementing different algorithms, and apply them to real-world (or example) datasets.


## About This Repository

This repository serves as a personal log and a showcase of my hands-on learning in Machine Learning. Each project or concept explored will typically have its own directory containing:
*   Jupyter/Google Colab Notebooks (`.ipynb`) with code, explanations, and visualizations.
*   Datasets used (or links to them if they are large).
*   Any relevant helper scripts or notes.

## Modules & Projects Covered

Here's a summary of the topics and projects I've worked on so far:

###  Data Preprocessing
Understanding that clean and well-prepared data is the cornerstone of any successful ML model, I've focused on:
*   **Handling Missing Values:** Techniques to identify and impute missing data points.
*   **Categorical Data Encoding:** Converting categorical features into numerical representations (e.g., One-Hot Encoding).
*   **Feature Scaling:** Standardizing or normalizing features to bring them to a similar range (e.g., StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler).
*   *(See: `https://github.com/getshakein-nish/machine_learning/blob/main/DataPreprocessing.ipynb`)*

###  Linear Regression
My first dive into supervised learning, predicting a continuous outcome based on a single input feature.
*   **Project: Employee Salary Prediction**
    *   Goal: Predict an employee's salary based on their years of experience.
    *   Outcome: Built a simple linear regression model and evaluated its performance.
    *   *(See: `https://github.com/getshakein-nish/machine_learning/blob/main/SimpleLinearRegression.ipynb`)*

###   Multiple Regression
Extending linear regression to handle multiple input features.
*   **Project: Startup Profitability Prediction**
    *   Goal: Analyze data from various startups (R&D Spend, Administration, Marketing Spend, State) to predict their profit and identify the 10 most promising ones for investment.
    *   Outcome: Developed a multiple linear regression model, considering factors like dummy variables for categorical features and feature selection/elimination.
    *   *(See: `https://github.com/getshakein-nish/machine_learning/blob/main/MultipleLinearRegression.ipynb`)*

###  Polynomial Regression
Exploring how to model non-linear relationships between variables.
*   **Project: Advanced Salary Prediction**
    *   Goal: Predict employee salaries based on their job level, where the relationship isn't strictly linear.
    *   Outcome: Implemented a polynomial regression model to better fit the data and capture the non-linear trend.
